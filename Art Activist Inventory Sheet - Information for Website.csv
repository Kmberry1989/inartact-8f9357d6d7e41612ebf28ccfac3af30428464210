While he is famous for his vinyl portraits, he considers his real estate development to be an extension of his art practice. Here is the breakdown of his ""top form"" (the campus) and his ""top piece"" (the exhibition that defines his philosophy). 1. The ""Top Form"" of Activism: B-SIDE Creative Campus What it is: This is not a painting or a sculpture; it is a neighborhood revitalization project in the Brookside area of Indianapolis (where Hamilton grew up). The Activist Act: Hamilton buys blighted, abandoned properties (like old churches or storefronts) and renovates them into subsidized live/work studios for other artists. Why it is Activism: This is Anti-Gentrification Activism. The Problem: Usually, when artists make a neighborhood ""cool,"" developers move in, raise the rent, and kick the artists out. The Solution: By owning the land and controlling the rent, Hamilton creates a ""safe zone"" (what he calls ""Creative Care"") where local Black artists can afford to stay and build wealth in their own community. He is using art proceeds to buy back the block.",,,,,,,,
